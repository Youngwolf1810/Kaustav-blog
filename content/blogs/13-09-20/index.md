###Introduction

Hello All! This is the first time I am
writing a blog!! This is completely new to me
which makes it more interesting!!!

Coming to the point straightaway,recently I have
seen students debating over whether to
do online courses on sites like Udemy,Coursera,
Udacity etc. or to build projects on their own in order
to gain a new skill.
While this is a very common confusion
among students let's talk about
the aspects of both.

###Online Courses
Let's talk about online courses.While sites
like Udemy,Udacity etc. were already there from
before, the online learning curve has seen
a steep rise in this pandemic.While people
are in their home,everyone is looking to
use these sites to their advantage for learning
new skills.Be it learning a new language or mastering the new framework currently in the market...
curated courses are there for everything you
are looking forward to learn!

####Can online courses make you a master?
Well...truly you cannot be good at anything
unless you give it a try.Online courses are
good enough to introduce you to libraries,
frameworks,the basics of a language.But unless you yourself go out there and explore more
on your own it won't benefit much.

####Are online courses waste of money then?
No of course not.But learning every new course
out there just for the sake of certificates definitely is.The job of these sites is to lure you into buying courses which sometimes may not be very useful for you.You yourself have to figure out what exactly you need which
will help you get the initial boost.

### Building Projects

As I was saying earlier,no matter how many
courses you get yourself enrolled into,if
you truly want to master something,practice is the only key.

Building a project from scratch truly helps in
strengthening your concept.You encounter
thousands of difficulties...you search for the correct solution...
you learn a lot of other things along the way.That's how it should be.

After completing a course,instead of jumping into another,take some time.Build something with what you have learnt.Read the docs of the library/framework you came to know about in the course.If a project was built in the course improvise on that.Knowledge is not much of use if you are not applying it.

###Thoughts
I think I have made my point.While courses can be helpful to get you an introduction,only practice can make you better day by day.

####what should I do then?
Do what suits you better.Some people are pretty comfortable going through the documentation and building something from scratch right from the start,others(including me) find a course more helpful to begin with.Totally depends on you.

> At the end of the day only one thing matters.PRACTICE!

Woah! It's been quite a long post.Never imagined I would write this much on my first post! Hope you liked it.Feel free to drop a message if you did.
