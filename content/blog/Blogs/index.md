###Online Courses vs building projects

Hello All! This is the first time I am
writing a blog!! This is completely new to me
which makes it more interesting!!!

Coming to the point straightaway,recently I have
seen people debating over whether to
do online courses on sites like Udemy,Coursera,
Udacity etc. or to build projects in order
to gain a new skill.
While this is a very common confusion
among students I decided to point out
the aspects of both.

###Online Courses
Let's talk about online courses.While sites
like Udemy,Udacity were already there from
before, the online learning curve has seen
a steep rise in this pandemic.While people
are in their home,everyone is looking to 
use these sites to their advantage for learning
new skills to keep up with rapdily advancing technology.
